We have a number of group members that are interested in learning to code across various backgrounds and prior learning levels. In future, we may want to run events targeted to support these individuals. Some resources that can help us do that are:

## Django Girls
[https://djangogirls.org/en/canberra/](https://djangogirls.org/en/canberra/)
We've previously run a one day workshop that was well attended and well received. The main blocker for future events is the overhead required in terms of getting the event set up and ready to run. It's something we're confident we could run again, but lack the capacity on the organising team at the moment.

## Beginners Python and Machine Learning

Mentioned at today's meetup by organiser @anniequasar, the group has a lot of resources already online and appears to have a solid format for events that we may be able to reuse in future if there is interest from our members

## Girls Programming Network
[https://www.girlsprogramming.network/canberra](https://www.girlsprogramming.network/canberra)
While GPN focuses on teaching high schoolers (not adults) to code, teaching others is a great way to learn and GPN encourages those with less experience to still get involved as mentors. We're working with them to promote their upcoming event on March 23rd and will be keen to understand if this can be part of how we support group members in their learning and development going forward

## Software Carpentry
[https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
Provides free lesson material readily available online. We've discussed potentially using this as a different basis for a workshop similar to Django Girls. Similar to Django Girls, the main barrier has been organiser capacity
