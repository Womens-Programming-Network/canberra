Third get-together of a network.

---

 Organising:

 * Meetup
 * Deciding on location
 * Packing post-its and pens

Format:

**Intros**: 

* Name (reference)
* Background
* What we want from the group (or what we're excited about at the moment)

**Q&Discussion**

* Write Qs on post-its
* Put dots/stars on things to discuss (4x stars each person to allocate)

**Planning Next**

* Location <- will possibly change from ANU if we do a themed event with a coporate partner
* Cadence (aim is for 1 event every second month, 2nd Sunday of the month)
* Discussed using github to allow for more open engagement of group members with organising efforts
